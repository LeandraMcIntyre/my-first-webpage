    <p>On the taxi ride to our hotel, and after trying to greet us in at least three different languages, our charming driver made the first of what would be a few comments that made me feel at home:</p>

    <p><em>You don't speak Papiamento? I thought you were a native!</em></p>
        
    <p>Upon explaining to him that, no, I was just there visiting, he again commented on how much I would fit in with the locals. He wasn't the only one to make such comments, but he was the first and I charish that.</p>
